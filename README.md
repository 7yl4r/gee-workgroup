## Tasks for next meeting:
For everyone:
1. Identify the type of dataset/imagery needed
2. Try to import dataset and filter by study area and time
3. Add layers to map

<b>Bonus:</b> Get familiar with common types of variables (e.g. ee.Image, ee.ImageCollection, ee.Feature) and ee functions (e.g. print(), Map.addLayer, ee.Filter, etc)
